        <h1>The Global Burden of Climate Change</h1>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
         As we as a society look at ways to address the global warming crisis, there is a struggle between scientists pushing for fast and decisive action to save the planet, and policy makers looking to balance short term needs like employment and economic growth. Green alternatives are unfortunately not always the most economical and the economic costs often disproportionately affect more vulnerable groups. Developing countries often bear more of the burden of climate change and are less equipped to adapt. On a global scale, we must determine what nations are currently impacted by the impacts of global warming, and what nations stand to be impacted most in the coming years. What countries are the biggest polluters? What climate change solutions can equitably and positvely affect all nations equitably? How can the burden of economic impacts of these solutions be equitably distributed?
            A good place to start is by examining trends in climate change globally over the last half a century. The easiest way to see that is to look at average temperatures across the globe and how they have changed in the last fifty years. The interactive map below can be used to examine the change from the average temperature from 1951-1980 to the present. The legend shows euqally positive and negative values for that change with one thought in mind: None of them are negative.

          <p>The above visualization helps to begin to show us who is most impacted, but it is also important to know who is contributing the most to climate change. The chart below visually shows the 10 biggest
                contributors in average annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by the combustion of coal, natural gas, oil, and other fuels, including industrial waste and
                non-renewable municipal waste data compiled by the Global Carbon Project. The realization that emerges from this figure is that, in general, developed
                countries and major emerging economy nations lead in total carbon dioxide emissions.These uneven contributions to the climate crisis
                are at the core of the challenges the world community faces in finding effective and equitable solutions to global warming. The disparity between developing countries being impacted the most by climate change
          while developed countries do the most polluting is further explored through the remainder of this project. We will also keep track of these top 10 carbon dioxide producers through the rest of our visualizations.</p>

           <h2>Global Analysis via the GAIN Index</h2>
          <p>Diving deeper into the environmental inequity between developing and developed nations, we found Notre Dame's Global Adaptation Initiative Index to be
              an invaluable resource. The GAIN Index aims
          to assess countries' exposure to climate change as well as their ability to adapt--quantified by a Vulnerability Score and a Readiness Score. The maps below
              provide a quick overview of GAIN scores from 2019. The map on the left shows the Vulnerability Score for each country,
          while the map on the right shows the Readiness Score. Vulnerability refers to the potential for negative impact due to climate change, while
          Readiness encompasses a country's capacity to leverage new technologies to take adaptive action. These scores are calculated using a multitude of
          indicators across various sectors: health, food, water, governance, energy, technology, economy, and so on. I chose a map to dispaly this data
          as it is powerful to see how geography plays a role in risk and readiness. By comparing between the two maps, we can see that many of the countries
          who are the most vulnerable to climate change are also the least ready to combat it--emphasizing the environmental inequity that exists between
          developed and developing countries, and how critical it is that fighting climate change is a worldwide effort. </p>

        <p>To further explore the insights the GAIN index provides, we compared countries' Vulnerability and Readiness scores and studied the trends and outleirs. The data is broken up into four quadrants based on Climate
        Vulnerability and Readiness. A negative sloping trend is apparent, showcasing that the countries at the highest risk are also the least prepared. Each
        data point's size is encoded by GDP per capita--it is very clear that poorer, developing countries, are much more adversely impacted by climate change and much
        less ready. This is a stark representation of the environmental inequity present across the globe that must be addressed as we think about solutions
        to climate change. </p>

    <h2>Poverty Levels and Climate Readiness & Vulnerability</h2>
                <p>Next, we began to look for relationships between GAIN scores and other metrics. Visualized here are several key metrics: Vulnerability Score (ND-Gain),
                    Readiness Score, and Poverty Level (calculated based on percent of a nation's citizens living below a baseline world income level). The two concerning
                    trends are quite obvious, yet concerning. Countries with a higher percentage of the population below the poverty level are far more vulnerable to factors
                    associated with climate change and are far less prepared for climate change. On the left hand graph, points are also color-coded based on their readiness
                    score, emphasizing how nations with high levels of poverty are both more vulnerable and less prepared. <p>

       <h2>Fossil Fuel Consumption</h2>
               <p>We next used the GAIN index to look at the imbalance between those who will be most impacted by climate change and those who are the main consumers
                   of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. To visualize this, we summed the fossil fuel consumption for individual nations over the past
                   twenty years and evaluated on a scatterplot for comparison of their climate Readiness score. Scaling by population was an option. However, the amount
                   of fossil fuels consumed by a country is directly proportional to its contribution of additional CO2 into the atmosphere, rather than a nation's fossil
                   fuel consumption per person. The visualization underscores an uncomfortable issue: countries that are less vulnerable and more prepared are also
                   predominantly responsible for global fossil fuel usage, whereas those who have contributed less to climate change, and additional atmospheric CO2, are
                   more vulnerable and less prepared. <p>

                       <p> As we acknowledge global environmental inequity, we must look at solutions. Using the axis Readiness vs Vulnerability, we can analyze a nation's
                           renewable energy production for the year 2019. A similar, but less pronounced trend appears. Less vulnerable and more ready nations utilize
                           renewable energy at a greater rate that less prepared and more vulnerable nations. Population size may play a role in scaling this graph. Overall,

          <h2>The Gini Coefficient</h2>
          <p>
            To confirm our earlier findings of across-country inequality present, we need to look at another tool far from the GAIN index. For this next comparison, we will look into the Gini coefficient comparisons of each country. 
            The Gini coefficient, developed by Corrado Gini in 1912, is a 0 to 1 value representing the statistical dispersion in the wealth of a country. For a quick example, a Gini value of 1.0 theoretically means that one person 
            owns all of the wealth in a country. Similarly, a Gini of 0.0 means that every citizen of a country has the exact same worth. Clearly, every country fits somewhere in between, varying from South Africa (0.61, high wealth inequality) 
            to the Czech Republic (0.23, low wealth inequality).
          </p>
          <p>
              The figure below shows two positive relationships between Gini value and different climate related statistics; municipal waste generated per capita and environmentally related taxes as a percent of each respective country’s GDP. 
              The two sides share different stories as well. Where countries with lower inequality actually create more municipal waste, but also tax higher on average to mitigate climate change. Although higher inequality entities do produce 
              less waste, it is clear that they don’t plan to invest in climate mitigation in comparison to some of their lower inequality counterparts.

            <h2>Air Pollution and GDP</h2>
            <p>It is usually assumed that developing countries struggle with air pollution more than developed countries since they are less likely to invest
                    in cleaner sources of energy because these renewable resources tend to be more expensive to procure than cheap and readily available fossil fuels like coal.
                    To check if that is the case, let us now analyze the global death rates from outdoor air pollution and the GDP per capita for each country to see
                    if there is a strong correlation between these two factors. Here, we constructed a scatterplot to show the relationship between the two quantitative variables being
                    measured and plotted a trendline to act as an approximation of the data points. From our trendline, we see that there is a negative trend. In addition, our R^2 value
                    (coefficient of determination) of 0.014926. The coefficient of determination can be thought of as a percent. It gives us an idea of how many data points
                    fall within the trend line. The higher the coefficient, the higher percentage of points the line passes through when the data points and line are plotted.
                    In this case, only 1.49% of the points fall within our trendline which indicates a very weak to almost nonexistent relationship between a country's GDP per capita
                    and air pollution death rates. Hence, we cannot automatically assume that developing countries are more at risk of the dangers of air pollution,
                    but it is still an issue that they cannot invest in clean energy and must rely on cheap fossil fuels in order for their economies to grow and stabilize.</p>

        <h2>Possible Solutions: Renewable Energy Jobs</h2>
        <p>
            From the information presented above, it is clear that the world’s leading carbon dioxide producers are also ready to tackle the challenge of climate change much more effectively than some of the other countries around the globe. As such, 
            even within countries, low income groups are much more susceptible to damage from climate hazards. Beyond that, these lower income groups are at an extreme disadvantage in terms to their ability to cope with and recover from the damage done. 
            This vicious cycle sees low-GDP countries and areas disproportionately effected by both more damage done and longer recovery times.
        </p>
        <p>
            In turn, the countries that are less vulnerable, like the top 10 shown, struggle to pass legislation to mitigate climate change to a greater extant, simply because they are not affected to the degree of other countries around the globe. 
            The figure below shows this effect. Six of the top ten greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters fall below the world average renewable energy job ratio. This signals a “job debt”, or a lack of effort/money put into mitigating climate change through 
            increased green energy production.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Six of the top ten greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters fall below the world average renewable energy job ratio.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            If these countries would lead other by raising the trend line shown below, the world stands a better chance of stopping irreversible changes to the environment that seem imminent in this day and age.

            <p> The following dashboard showcases 2019 employment figures in the renewable energy sector worldwide by country (specifically, the 10 big carbon dioxide emitters) and technology. 
                For context of the different technologies that we distinguished in the dashboard, let us briefly explain each one. </p>
            <p> Solar photovoltaic technology utilizes "certain materials and devices to convert sunlight into electrical energy" (United States Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, n.d.). </p>
            <p> Liquid biofuels is made from converting biomass (various plant materials) directly into liquid fuels used for transportation needs. 
                The two most common types of biofuels in use today are ethanol and biodiesel. 
                Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) is a renewable fuel that can be made from biomass and "is an alcohol used as a blending agent with gasoline to increase octane 
                and cut down carbon monoxide and other smog-causing emissions" (United States Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, n.d.). 
                Biodiesel is a liquid fuel produced from new and used vegetable oils and animal fats.
                It is meant to be "cleaner-burning replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuel" (United States Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, n.d.). </p>
            <p> Hydropower technology utilizes flowing water to create energy that can be captured and turned into electricity. </p>
            <p> Wind technology uses wind to produce electricity through the kinetic energy created by air in motion. 
                This is transformed into electrical energy using devices such as wind turbines or various other wind energy conversion systems. </p>
            <p> Solar heating/cooling technologies "collect the thermal energy from the sun and use this heat to provide hot water, space heating, cooling, 
                and pool heating for residential, commercial, and industrial applications" (Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), 2021). </p>
            <p> Biomass is renewable organic material that comes from plants and animals. Examples include wood, agricultural crops, paper, cotton, etc. 
                Biomass contains stored chemical energy from the sun. "Biomass can be burned directly for heat or converted to renewable liquid and gaseous 
                fuels through various processes" (U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), 2020). </p>
            <p> Biogas is a renewable fuel produced by the breakdown of organic matter such as food scraps and animal waste. "It’s produced when organic matter, such as food or animal waste, 
                is broken down by microorganisms in the absence of oxygen, in a process called anaerobic digestion" (National Grid plc, 2021). </p>
            <p> Geothermal technology uses heat energy from within the sub-surface of the earth. Water and/or steam carry the geothermal energy to the Earth’s surface. 
                "Depending on its characteristics, geothermal energy can be used for heating and cooling purposes or be harnessed to generate clean electricity" (International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2020). </p>
            <p> Municipal and industrial waste to energy technology uses municipal solid waste (MSW) or otherwise known as garbage to produce energy. 
                MSW contains biomass (paper, food waste, etc.) and nonbiomass materials (plastic, glass, metals, etc.). 
                "MSW is usually burned at special waste-to-energy plants that use the heat from the fire to make steam for generating electricity or to heat buildings" (U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), 2020). </p>
            <p> Concentrating Solar-Thermal Power (CSP) uses mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto a receiver. "The energy from the concentrated sunlight heats a high temperature 
                fluid in the receiver" (United States Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, n.d.). The thermal energy is then used to spin 
                turbines or power engines to generate electricity, which has applications in food processing, chemical production, and mineral processing. </p>
            <p> Tide, Wave and Ocean technology, like the name suggests, utilizies tides, waves, and currents that can be used to produce electricity. 
                However, it is still "at the research and development stage and not yet commercially available" (International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2020). 
                Though, there are promising technologies being developed such as "oscillating water columns that trap air pockets to drive a turbine; 
                oscillating body converters that use wave motion; and overtopping converters that make use of height differences" (International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2020). </p>
            <p> In this dashboard, we see that there were approxiametly 11,459,000 million clean energy jobs created globally in 2019. In 2018, the IRENA reported that, globally, 
                the renewable energy sector employed 11 million people, which was also a 700,000 increase from 2017 (Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI), 2019). 
                From this, we can note that there is a positive upwards trend in the increase and expansion of the clean energy sector on a worldwide scale. 
                Across the globe, solar PV provides the highest employment in the renewable energy sector, with around 3,755,000 jobs. Biofuels and hydropower follow closely behind, 
                employing around 2,475,000 and 1,957,000 people, respectively. </p>
            <p> According to the 2019 U.S. Energy Employment Report (USEER), 611,000 people worked in zero-emission technology industries, including renewables 
                in the United States. This positive trend of increased employment is also wintessed within the specific various sectors of renewable energy. 
                For example, the 2019 USEER also reported that the solar energy industry provided 334,992 direct jobs in solar energy manufacturing, installation,
                distribution, and support services, about 242,343 of which were full-time positions. In addition, the wind power industry provided 111,166 jobs in 2018, 
                increasing four percent from 2017. "The industry is growing, especially for turbine service technicians, which was the second-fastest growing 
                occupation across the entire economy in 2018" (Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI), 2019). </p>
            <!-- going to add more here -->
            <p> We can also note that China is the largest provider of total renewable energy jobs worldwide. Within the data that the IRENA collected, 
                China also leads, in terms of employment, in five different renewable energy sectors which are solar PV, wind, solar heating/cooling, biogas, and CSP. 
                China leads the world in solar PV employment, providing around 2,214,000 direct and indirect jobs, or about 50.7 percent of the renewable energy 
                jobs in China. China is increasing exports of solar PV to "emerging markets through their International Investment Alliance for Renewable Energy" 
                (Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI), 2019). In solar heating and cooling, China employs 670,000 people 
                (approximately 15.3 percent of renewable energy jobs in China). China’s other large renewable energy employment sectors include wind power with 
                518,000 jobs (11.8 percent), hydropower with 561,000 jobs (12.8 percent), and solid biomass with 188,000 jobs (4.3 percent). </p>
            <p> India has the fourth largest number of renewable energy jobs globally, employing 832,700 people directly and indirectly in the sector. 
                "This is an increase of 303,000 jobs since 2015" (Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI), 2019). 
                Hydropower is the leading provider of renewable energy jobs in India, employing 367,200 people or around 44 percent of renewable energy jobs 
                in the country. Following recent trends, India’s solar PV sector was its second largest renewable energy employer, supporting roughly 204,000 
                direct and indirect jobs (24.5 percent of renewable energy jobs). India’s other large renewable energy employers include the biogas industry 
                (85,000 jobs or 10.2 percent), the solid biomass industry (58,000 jobs or about 7 percent), the wind power industry (62,800 jobs or about 7.5 percent), 
                and the liquid biofuels industry (35,100 jobs or 4.2 percent). </p>
            <p> According to the IRENA, Germany has 308,500 jobs in renewable energy which gives it the largest renewable energy workforce in Europe. 
                About 39.4 percent of Germany’s renewable energy jobs are in the wind sector (121,700 jobs). Germany also has 44,600 jobs in solid biomass 
                (making up about 14.5 percent of its renewable energy workforce), 41,000 jobs in biogas (13.3 percent), 38,200 jobs in solar PV (12.4 percent), 
                and 23,400 jobs in geothermal energy (about 7.6 percent). </p>
            <p> The IRENA reports that Japan is the world’s sixth largest renewable energy employer, supporting roughly 265,300 direct and indirect jobs. 
                Japan’s renewable energy sector is dominated by solar PV, with 249,800 of its jobs in that field (94.1 percent of total jobs in the 
                renewable energy sector). About 9,200 jobs are in hydropower (3.4 percent). </p>

            <p> From this increased demand from the renewable energy sector across the world, global CO2 emissions have begun to flatten and even decrease to some extent. 
                According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CO2 emissions flattened in 2019 at around 33 gigatonnes (Gt), following two years of increases. 
                "Global CO2 emissions from coal use declined by almost 200 million tonnes (Mt), or 1.3%, from 2018 levels, offsetting increases in emissions from oil 
                and natural gas" (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2020). This result was due to a noticeable decline in CO2 emissions from energy/power sectors 
                in advanced economies such as the United States, Germany (including the rest of the European Union), Japan, etc. in which their "emissions declined by 
                over 370 Mt (or 3.2%), with the power sector responsible for 85% of the drop" (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2020) along with the expansion in 
                the utilization of renewable sources (mainly solar PV and wind like we witness in the dashboard). </p>
            <p> In 2020, "as primary energy demand dropped nearly 4% in 2020, global energy-related CO2 emissions fell by 5.8%" (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2021). 
                During this year, fossil fuel (mainly oil) and coal demand decreased by 8.6% and 4%, respectively. "Oil’s annual decline was its largest ever, 
                accounting for more than half of the drop in global emissions" (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2021). Much of this decline during 2020 can be 
                attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic impacts on transportation and aviation. However, the renewable energy sector remained 
                resilient in 2020 as cleaner fuels and technologies, primarily solar PV and wind, increased their annual share of the global energy consumption by 
                "more than one percentage point to over 20%" (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2021). </p>
            <p> It is apparent that as the demand for energy from renewable sources increases then there will be a decrease in the demand for traditional sources such as oil, coal, and gas. 
                Naturally, workers and communities reliant on fossil fuels for jobs and economic prosperity need to be protected and prepared in this transition. 
                Let us consider the case of Boone County, West Virginia which is a "local government reliant on taxes from coal operations to build roads, schools and other public resources
                saw their funding decline by half in the past five years from coal mine closures" (Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), 2020). </p>
            <p> Due to more cases like Boone County, there is a need for supportive policies and programs as economic opportunities shift towards to renewable energy. 
                Policymakers and governments need to ensure that all workers and communities can thrive in this clean energy economy with good paying jobs and benefits. 
                To fully support these displaced fossil fuel workers and communities facing a rough transition, policymakers should consider the impact such as losses 
                to families and surrounding businesses within these fossil fuel dependent region(s). This can be accomplished through the utilization of research in 
                order to gain the proper insights to develop appropriate policies to ensure a fair and safe future for these communities. </p>
            <p> Governments play an important key role in driving the transition into more reliable and accessible renewable energy production. Through policy, coordination, and increased social 
                awareness, many of the barriers of transition can largely be avoided. Social forums with an emphasis on dialogue such as task forces, councils, etc. 
                can be effective in incorporating skills and policy needs into current and future environmental policies, which will reduce skill gaps and labor 
                shortages in order to sustain the positive employment trends and environmental effects we are witnessing. 
                Further financial investment will greatly help drive the transition to renewable energy and job creation. 
                It is also worth noting that awareness and general public understanding of the opportunities being created from this shift to renewable energy on both a 
                social and environmental level form the foundation on which we can build upon to work towards a more cleaner Earth to ensure a better future. </p>
