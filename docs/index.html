        <h2>Update</h2>
        <p>This is the preliminary project update for our final project on Environmental Equity. The following
           visualizations are not ready for publishing yet and may still have issues. As we continue to refine our final deliverable, 
           we will create more visualizations and come up with a central narrative guding our project. Our visualizations and descriptive 
           text included in this checkpoint are definitely 'rough drafts' and will continue to be refined. We have each found several 
           academic papers and articles to support our visualizations that will continue to be incorporated as we continue work on our project.
           Lastly, we mainly followed the template of the instruction team's example index.html file for now, but we will use our style.css
           file to customize and make the formatting our own as we continue to work!

        <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
        <p>We were inspired by the compilation of datasets found at https://www.kaggle.com/seraphimstreets/environmentequity-starterpack as well as Notre Dame's Global Adaptation Initiatiave Index (https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/download-data/) to focus our final porject on evironmnetal equity. As we look at ways to address the global warming crisis, there is a struggle between scientists pushing for fast and decisive action to save the planet, and policy makers looking to balance short term needs like employment and economic growth. Green alternatives are unfortunately not always the most economical and the economic costs often disproportionately affect more vulnerable groups. Developing countries often bear more of the burden of climate change and are less equipped to adapt. Our project will aim to answer the following questions: What groups are currently impacted by the impacts of global warming, and what groups stand to be impacted most in the coming years? What climate change solutions can equitably and positvely affect all groups? How can the burden of economic impacts of these solutions be equitably distributed?
